# Introduction 

# Origins

Origins is a platform incentivization program aimed at gathering user feedback and rigorously testing the protocol. Users are incentivized to use Ordinox, deposit assets, trade, and provide liquidity (LP) into pools to earn points and gain access to early platform features. A more elaborate write-up on how these points function will be provided at a later point in time.
