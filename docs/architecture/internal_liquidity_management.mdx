# Internal Liquidity Management

ODX maintains sufficient USDT liquidity on all supported blockchains and treats USDT on different chains as interchangeable. This approach allows cross-chain swaps without the need to bridge or burn tokens, simplifying the transaction process and reducing associated risks.

## USDT Liquidity Pools:
- ODX operates USDT liquidity pools on Chains $C$ and $D$ (as per the previous usecase example).
- These pools are funded by liquidity providers (LPs) who supply USDT to the platform.

## Liquidity Pool Balances and Fee Distribution
During cross-chain swaps, the liquidity pools are adjusted to reflect the movement of USDT. A small fee is charged on these swaps, which is credited to the LPs providing the USDT liquidity.

** Swap Fee: **
- A 0.15% fee is applied to the amount of USDT involved in the swap.
- This fee is accrued to the LPs as an incentive for providing liquidity.
- Fee can be changed in the future with governance proposal

### Balance Adjustments

Let:

- $U_C$ = Amount of USDT received from swapping Asset $A$ on Chain $C$.
- $F$ = Swap fee percentage (0.15% or 0.0015).
- $U_C^{net}$ = Net USDT amount after deducting the fee.
- $L^C_{USDT}$ = USDT liquidity pool balance on Chain $C$.
- $L^D_{USDT}$ = USDT liquidity pool balance on Chain $D$.

#### Example:

1. **Fee Deduction**:

   - **Fee Amount** $F_{amount}$:

     $$
     F_{amount} = U_C \times F = U_C \times 0.0015
     $$

   - **Net USDT Amount After Fee** $U_C^{net}$:

     $$
     U_C^{net} = U_C - F_{amount}
     $$

2. **Liquidity Pool Balance Updates**:

   - **On Chain $C$**:
     - **Decrease USDT Liquidity Pool by Net Amount**:

       $$
       L^C_{USDT} = L^C_{USDT} - U_C^{net}
       $$

     - **Increase LP Rewards by Fee Amount**:

       The fee collected $F_{amount}$ is credited to the LPs on Chain $C$.

   - **On Chain $D$**:
     - **Increase USDT Liquidity Pool by Net Amount**:

       $$
       L^D_{USDT} = L^D_{USDT} + U_C^{net}
       $$

3. **Net Effect**:

   - **Total USDT Holdings**:

     The total USDT across all chains remains balanced, excluding the fee collected:

     $$
     L^{Total}_{USDT} = L^C_{USDT} + L^D_{USDT} = \text{Constant} - F_{amount}
     $$

---

## Fee Distribution to Liquidity Providers

- **Incentivizing LPs**:

  The 0.15% fee collected from swaps is distributed proportionally among the LPs who have supplied USDT to the liquidity pools on Chain $C$.

- **LP Reward Calculation**:

  For an individual liquidity provider $i$ with a share $s_i$ of the total liquidity pool on Chain $C$:

  $$
  \text{LP Reward}_i = F_{amount} \times s_i
  $$

  Where:

  - $s_i = \frac{\text{LP's USDT Provided}}{\text{Total USDT in Pool on Chain } C}$

## Ensuring Liquidity Pool Health

### Balancing Liquidity:

ODX monitors the liquidity pools to ensure sufficient USDT is available on all chains.

### Liquidity Provision Incentives:

The fee mechanism encourages LPs to provide liquidity, enhancing the platform's capacity to handle large swap volumes.

### Rebalancing Strategies:

If liquidity becomes uneven across chains, ODX will implement strategies such as:

1. Incentivized Liquidity Shifts, offering higher rewards on chains with lower liquidity to attract more LPs.

2. Operational Transfers, where ODX may internally adjust liquidity using operational funds to maintain balance.

### Benefits of the Fee Structure

1. Users enjoy transparent fee structure with a minimal impact on the swap amount with an assurance of sufficient liquidity for seamless swaps.

2. Liquidity Providers earn passive income through fees accrued from swap transactions, while encourages long-term participation in the liquidity pools.
