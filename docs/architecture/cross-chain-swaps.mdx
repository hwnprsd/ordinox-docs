# Cross Chain Swaps and Transactions

When a user initiates a cross-chain swap, Ordinox orchestrates a series of actions to execute the transaction seamlessly.

- User requests to swap Asset $A$ on Chain $C$ to Asset $B$ on Chain $D$
- Ordinox's Transaction Orchestrator (TO) breaks down the request into atomic operations
- Ordinox uses the integrated DEX on Chain $C$ (e.g., Uniswap) to swap Asset $A$ to USDT/USDC.
- Swap $A$ to USDT on Chain $C$ using a natively integrated DEX on $C$
- Amount of USDT Received $U_C$:

	$$
	U_C = A \times P^C_{A \rightarrow USDT}
	$$

	Where $P^C_{A \rightarrow USDT}$ is the price rate from the DEX on Chain $C$.
- Ordinox treats USDT on Chain $C$ and Chain $D$ as interchangeable.
- No Bridging or Burning. There is no actual transfer of USDT between chains. Ordinox's maintained liquidity allows it to offset the USDT balance internally.
- Ordinox uses the integrated DEX on Chain $D$ (e.g., Raydium) to swap USDT to Asset $B$.
- Amount of Asset $B$ Received $B_D$:
     $$
     B_D = U_C \times P^D_{USDT \rightarrow B}
     $$

     Where $P^D_{USDT \rightarrow B}$ is the price rate from the DEX on Chain $D$.
- The user's Ordinox account is credited with $B_D$.
- SSE updates the states $S_{B_i}$ for Chains $C$ and $D$.
- Ordinox confirms transaction completion to the user.
