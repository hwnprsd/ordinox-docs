# Components and Security

### Fund Sanctioning and Management
When users deposit funds into a vault, Ordinox sanctions the transaction by approving and recording it within its blockchain network. This process ensures that all fund movements are transparent and secure, monitored by the network's consensus mechanism. Ordinox maintains strict control over the movement of funds, ensuring they can only be allocated to whitelisted underlying vaults on native blockchains. This prevents unauthorized transfers and enhances security.

### Curator Role and Vault Creation
Curators play a vital role in managing Compound Vaults. They propose new vaults and strategies, which are subject to approval through Ordinox's governance process. Once a vault is approved, the curator manages the assets within the parameters set by the governance proposal. Importantly, curators never have direct access to user funds; all transactions are executed through smart contracts that enforce the vault's rules and limitations.

### Active Management and Optimization
In Compound Vaults, curators actively manage the asset allocations to optimize yields. They monitor performance across different DeFi protocols and adjust strategies accordingly. For instance, if a particular asset or protocol is underperforming, the curator may reallocate funds to another asset or strategy that offers better returns. This dynamic management aims to maximize yields while managing risk, providing users with an optimized yield farming experience.

### Security Measures
Ordinox places a strong emphasis on security throughout its yield farming engine. All fund movements are secured by the Ordinox blockchain and monitored by its consensus mechanism. Additionally, the platform leverages AVS partners to enhance security further. Funds can only be moved into whitelisted underlying vaults, and smart contracts are designed to prevent any unauthorized access or misuse of funds. This ensures that user assets are protected at all times.
