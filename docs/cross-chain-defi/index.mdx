# Cross Chain DeFi

In the rapidly evolving world of DeFi, many users find themselves siloed within single blockchain ecosystems, limiting their access to the diverse yield opportunities available across different networks. This siloing often happens because participating in other ecosystems requires navigating entirely different platforms, protocols, and tools, or simply due to a lack of awareness about opportunities elsewhere. As a result, users miss out on potentially lucrative DeFi strategies that exist beyond their familiar platforms.

Ordinox addresses this challenge by democratizing access to DeFi, allowing everyone to seamlessly tap into the best yield earning opportunities that multiple blockchains have to offer. By simplifying cross-chain interactions, Ordinox eliminates the complexities of managing multiple wallets and networks. Users can now participate in yield earning across different chains through a single, unified platform, maximizing their DeFi participation without barriers.

## Ordinox's Yield Farming Engine - Simple Vaults and Compound Vaults
Ordinox's yield farming engine revolves around two main types of vaults:

- **Simple Vaults**: These involve single assets and are designed for straightforward staking and yield generation on a specific blockchain.
- **Compound Vaults**: These involve multiple assets across different blockchains, allowing for diversified strategies and cross-chain yield optimization.

## User Interface
Users interact with a clean, chain-agnostic interface where they can view a curated list of vaults, each displaying essential information such as the vault name, curator, strategy description, and expected Annual Percentage Yield (APY). This simplified presentation enables users to make informed decisions without needing to understand the underlying technical details.

## Security and Governance
All Vaults are secured natively by Ordinox, ensuring that funds can only be moved into whitelisted Underlying Vaults on native chains and never to a curator's personal address. This security measure is enforced by the smart contracts deployed on the supported chains and monitored by Ordinox's chain consensus mechanisms. It ensures that any asset movement is transparent, auditable, and compliant with the platform's security protocols.

Additionally, Ordinox collaborates with AVS partners to provide an extra layer of security. These partnerships enhance the protection of users' DeFi activities by offering advanced monitoring and validation of transactions.

Vaults may charge a performance fee, which is set by the curator and must be approved through a governance proposal. This democratic process allows the community to have a say in the management of Vaults and ensures that users are aware of any fees before participating. The governance model fosters transparency and aligns the interests of curators and users, promoting a healthy and sustainable DeFi ecosystem within Ordinox.
