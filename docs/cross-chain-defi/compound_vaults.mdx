# Compound Vaults

Compound Vaults offer a more sophisticated yield farming experience by involving multiple assets across different blockchains. These vaults are managed by curatorsâ€”experienced DeFi strategists who design and implement various yield strategies within the vaults.

Users deposit funds into a Compound Vault, and ODX sanctions these funds similarly to Simple Vaults. However, in the background, the funds are allocated across different underlying vaults on various blockchains. The curators actively manage these allocations, rebalancing the assets based on performance and market conditions to optimize yields. This could involve shifting assets between different DeFi protocols, adjusting the ratio of assets held, or employing hedging strategies to manage risk.

The key advantage for users is access to a diversified, actively managed portfolio without needing to navigate the complexities themselves. Users benefit from the curator's expertise and the vault's cross-chain capabilities, potentially achieving higher yields than single-asset strategies.
