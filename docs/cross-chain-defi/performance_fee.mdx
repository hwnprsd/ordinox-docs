# Performance Fees

Vaults may charge a performance fee, which is set by the curator and approved through a governance proposal. This fee compensates the curator for their expertise and the active management of the vault. Users are made aware of any performance fees before they deposit funds, ensuring transparency.

The governance process allows the ODX community to have a say in the creation and management of vaults. Proposals for new vaults or changes to existing ones are submitted and voted on by the community, ensuring that the platform remains aligned with users' interests.
