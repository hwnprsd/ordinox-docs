# Welcome to Ordinox

Welcome to Ordinox,we enable cross-chain swaps, focusing on enriching the DeFi liquidity of BRC20 and other tokens on Bitcoin. As an Automated Market Maker (AMM) built on top of the Cosmos SDK, we facilitate effortless swaps between ERC20 tokens and your preferred tokens on Bitcoin.

At Ordinox, we prioritize the integrity and security of your assets. Unlike typical bridges or wrapping services, we don't alter your assets. They remain secured by their original parent chains while we serve as the intermediary enabling swaps across these chains.

Our platform leverages a combination of reliable and well-established security solutions to safeguard this cross-chain liquidity. This includes the GG20 Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS), a trusted standard among major exchanges and protocols, and the CometBFT consensus algorithm via the Cosmos SDK, which stands as a pillar in the crypto community.

We invite you to explore our documentation to gain a comprehensive understanding of our protocol. Dive in to discover the innovative ways Ordinox is set to revolutionize the BRC20 and Runes ecosystems, making DeFi liquidity for tokens on BTC more accessible than ever before.
