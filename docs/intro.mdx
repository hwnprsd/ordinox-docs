# Welcome to Ordinox

Ordinox is a simple DeFi app-chain built using the Tendermint consensus engine, Cosmos-SDK state machine, and GG20 Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS). It is a standalone Layer 1 decentralized exchange (DEX) created using the Cosmos SDK.

With Ordinox, users can swap between various assets on Bitcoin, such as BRC20s and Runes, and also swap them for EVM assets like USDC and USDT. It provides transparent and fair pricing without the need for a central middleman. The protocol currently uses continuous liquidity pools to improve efficiency. Instead of wrapping or pegging assets, Ordinox handles funds directly in on-chain vaults and protects them using various economic security measures. 

Ordinox is an automated market-maker (AMM), similar to Uniswap, but it is specifically designed for easy swaps between assets on Bitcoin.

At Ordinox, the integrity and security of vault assets are prioritized. Unlike typical bridges or wrapping services, assets are not altered. They remain secured by their original parent chains while Ordinox serves as the intermediary enabling swaps across these chains.

The platform leverages a combination of reliable and well-established security solutions to safeguard cross-chain liquidity. This includes the GG20 Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS), a trusted standard among major exchanges and protocols, and the CometBFT consensus algorithm via the Cosmos SDK, a cornerstone in the crypto community.

Explore the documentation to gain a comprehensive understanding of the protocol. Discover how Ordinox is revolutionizing the BRC20 and Runes ecosystems, making DeFi liquidity for tokens on BTC more accessible than ever before.
