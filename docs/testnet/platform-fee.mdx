# Platform Fee

When withdrawing Bitcoin assets, users are expected to pay a fee, which will be used to send the assets back to them. If users pay a higher fee, this amount will be included in the withdrawal transaction, increasing the likelihood of their transaction being included in the closest block.

Users can also choose to pay a lower fee and wait for more blocks before their transaction is confirmed in their wallet.

This system ensures that users have the flexibility to withdraw assets as quickly as they want, without using protocol funds to cover these withdrawals.
