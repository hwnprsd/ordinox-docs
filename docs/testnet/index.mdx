## Epochs and Feature Releases
Ordinox structures its testnet development and feature rollouts in defined periods known as epochs. Each epoch focuses on introducing new functionalities, enhancements, and integrations based on user feedback and developmental milestones.

### Epochs 1 to 3: Cross-Chain Swaps
***Cross-Chain Swap Enablement:*** The initial epochs centered on enabling users to perform cross-chain swaps seamlessly. Users could exchange assets across supported blockchains without the need to switch wallets or deal with complex interfaces.

***Performance Optimization:*** Feedback and data collected during these epochs were instrumental in optimizing transaction speeds, improving the user interface, and enhancing overall system stability.

### Epoch 4: TON Integration
TON (Telegram Open Network) Mini App: In the current fourth epoch, Ordinox has integrated with the TON Mini App, allowing users to interact with the platform directly through Telegram. This integration leverages Telegram's widespread user base to make Ordinox more accessible.

***Enhanced Accessibility:*** The TON Mini App simplifies the onboarding process, enabling users to manage their Ordinox accounts and perform cross-chain swaps within the familiar Telegram environment.
