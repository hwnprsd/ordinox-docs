# Understanding Ordinox

Ordinox is a decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol that works with the Tendermint consensus engine, Cosmos-SDK state machine, and GG20 Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS). It's a standalone Layer 1 decentralized exchange (DEX) created using the Cosmos SDK.

With Ordinox, users can easily swap assets between Ethereum (ERC20 tokens) and Bitcoin (Runes & BRC20 tokens) without having to use wrapped or pegged assets. It provides transparent and fair pricing without the need for central middlemen. The protocol uses continuous liquidity pools to improve efficiency. Instead of wrapping or pegging assets, Ordinox handles funds directly in on-chain vaults and protects them using economic security measures. Ordinox is like a cross-chain automated market maker (AMM), similar to Uniswap, but it's specifically designed for easy swaps between ERC20 tokens and Bitcoin's specific tokens.
