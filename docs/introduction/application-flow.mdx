# Application Flow


![Ordinox Application Flow](/img/ordinox-flow.png)

- **Action on Parent Chain:** A user decides to add liquidity to a pool or initiate a swap. This action is performed directly on the parent chain (Ethereum, BRC20, etc.).

- **Submission of Proof:** Following their action, the user creates a memo that signifies their intent. They sign this memo, which pairs with the Transaction ID (TxID) of the action they performed in step 1. This signed memo, along with the TxID, along with the SigHash is then submitted to the Ordinox network.

- **TxInQueue Entry:** The submitted information is placed into the TxInQueue, awaiting processing. The Equinox service within the Ordinox node is responsible for picking up entries from this queue.

- **Transaction Verification:** Equinox checks the validity of the transactions. It verifies that the user has indeed signed the combination of the memo and TxID correctly. To proceed, a supermajority of the network's validators must reach a consensus on the state of the TxIn. This consensus is crucial for ensuring that only valid transactions are processed. 

- **Performing the Requested Operation:** Once a transaction is verified onchain, Ordinox executes the requested action specified in the user memo â€” this could be adding liquidity, swapping assets, or removing liquidity. If necessary, the process involves pushing a TxOutItem into the TxOut Queue for outbound transactions (eg. Swapping, Removing Liquidity).

- **TxOut Processing:** The TxOutItem is then picked up by Equinox, which initiates a TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme) signing ceremony. This ceremony requires a supermajority of the validators to sign off on the outbound transaction, thereby legitimizing it.

- **Broadcast to Parent Network:** After successful verification and signing, the leader node of the Ordinox network broadcasts the transaction to the parent chain, completing the cycle.

## Smooth User Experience

The user experience with the Ordinox network is designed to be as smooth and hassle-free as possible, ensuring that users can interact with the network without the need for a Cosmos wallet or possessing any gas on the Ordinox network. This level of convenience is achieved through the support of community-run relayers, which abstract away the complexities of network interaction from the users.

Here's how it works:

- **Community Relayers:** These relayers are responsible for handling the transactions between the users and the Ordinox network. By leveraging these relayers, users are relieved from the necessity of managing Cosmos-specific resources or understanding the underlying technical processes.

- **Delegation to Third Parties:** Since the signed pair of transaction ID (txID) and memo does not contain any sensitive information, users can safely delegate the submission of these details to third parties. This means that entities interested in supporting the Ordinox ecosystem can run their own network relayers.

- **Ordinox Labs' Relayers:** To ensure a seamless user experience (UX), Ordinox Labs itself will operate relayers. Their involvement is aimed at making the interaction with the network as smooth as possible, reducing any potential friction for users.

- **Simplified User Interaction:** For users, the process is straightforward. All they need to do is sign a plain text message (which is human-readable) using their preferred wallet interface, such as MetaMask or UniSat. This signed message is then submitted to the Ordinox network via a relayer.
