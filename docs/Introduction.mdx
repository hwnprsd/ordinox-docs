Ordinox is a Layer 1 blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK, designed to unify liquidity across different blockchains. 
By tracking the state of all supported blockchains, Ordinox provides a chain-abstracted user experience. 
Users can manage their balances and perform DeFi actions across multiple chains using a single Ordinox account, without the need to switch wallets, networks, or applications.

## Components

- **Ordinox Account**: Controlled by any Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)-based wallet such as MetaMask, Phantom, or Trust Wallet. This widespread compatibility allows users to access Ordinox services using their existing wallets.

- **Signatures and Commands**: All actions on Ordinox, known as "Commands," are executed through chain signatures. This means users do not need to pay gas fees to Ordinox or interact directly with the blockchain, streamlining operations and reducing costs.

- **Ordinox Validators**: The blockchain is maintained by a permissionless set of validators who stake the native Ordinox token to participate in network consensus. Partnerships with AVS providers like Babylon further enhance network security and reliability.

- **Ordinox Relayers**: These are service providers that host instances to help users connect to the Ordinox chain. Relayers facilitate network connectivity and can charge a small fee subsidized by Ordinox based on their throughput and volume, ensuring efficient and reliable access for users.

## Consensus Mechanism

Ordinox utilizes the CometBFT consensus algorithm, as packaged in Cosmos SDK v0.5.0. This choice offers several benefits inherent to Cosmos chains:

- **High Scalability**: Capable of handling a large number of transactions per second, accommodating a growing user base and increased cross-chain activity.

- **Interoperability**: Designed to interact seamlessly with other blockchains, which is essential for Ordinox's cross-chain functionalities.

- **Modularity**: Allows for flexible development and integration of new features and services without disrupting the existing network.

- **Security**: Provides robust security features to protect the integrity of the network and the assets within it.

## **Unified Balances**

A unified balance in Ordinox means that a user's assets from different blockchains are consolidated within their Ordinox account. This centralization allows users to manage and utilize their assets across all supported chains without the need for multiple wallets or constant switching between networks.

#### **Asset Management**

- **Depositing Assets**: Users can deposit assets from any supported blockchain into their Ordinox account. Once deposited, these assets become part of the unified balance and are accessible for various activities within the platform.

- **Trading and DeFi Actions**: The unified balance enables users to trade assets or engage in DeFi activities seamlessly across different blockchains. Users can, for example, swap tokens from one blockchain to another or participate in yield farming without leaving the platform.

- **Withdrawing Assets**: Users retain full control over their assets and can withdraw them back to their native blockchains at any time. This flexibility ensures that users are not locked into the platform and can move assets as needed.

#### **Supported Blockchains**

- **To Be Disclosed**: The list of supported blockchains will be announced soon. Ordinox aims to include major blockchains to maximize user accessibility and liquidity options.
